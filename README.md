Campus Event Digital Ticketing & Management System

The project enabled secure digital access by implementing QR-code-based ticket generation and verification, allowing attendees to receive unique, encrypted digital tickets that streamline entry and reduce the chances of fraud. This system significantly enhanced the confirmation workflows by automating key processes, which resulted in a 60% reduction in ticket handling time for over 5,000 registrations and more than 2,500 tickets sold.
To ensure smooth and accountable event management, robust access controls were developed, allowing organizers and administrators to monitor ticket statuses effectively through dedicated dashboards. Comprehensive ticket audit trails were maintained to track and review ticketing activities, thereby promoting transparency and accountability within the 30-member team managing the ticketing operations.
Furthermore, the project improved financial transparency by integrating real-time payment tracking mechanisms for multiple payment methods such as Cash and UPI, coupled with daily automated digital reconciliation processes. This integration ensured accurate financial records and quick resolution of payment discrepancies, thereby enhancing trust and operational efficiency for large-scale event management.
This comprehensive digital ticketing and management system thus revolutionized the way event registration, verification, and financial tracking were conducted, making the entire process faster, more reliable, and highly secure.
